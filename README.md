# An open-source PhD Template

Works with MAC, Windows and Linux.

Get your PhD ready in five simple steps:
1. Download all the files and unzip them (or clone the repository)
2. Install the fonts. They are all in the "font" folder. Select all of them, right-click, and click "Install".
3. Put your .tex and .bib files in the "chapter" folders. If you want to add more chapters, just create new folders and edit the dissertation.tex file to add new entries.
4. Put all your figures in the "figures" folder
5. Run the file dissertation.tex

To compile, use xelatex, biblatex and biber. These are easily configurable with the IDE [TexStudio](http://twitter.com).

PS: for the bibliography, run the .tex file, then run Bibliography, then run the .tex twice.
