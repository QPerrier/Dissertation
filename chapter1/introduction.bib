abstract = {An analytical job creation model for the US power sector from 2009 to 2030 is presented. The model synthesizes data from 15 job studies covering renewable energy (RE), energy efficiency (EE), carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear power. The paper employs a consistent methodology of normalizing job data to average employment per unit energy produced over plant lifetime. Job losses in the coal and natural gas industry are modeled to project net employment impacts. Benefits and drawbacks of the methodology are assessed and the resulting model is used for job projections under various renewable portfolio standards (RPS), EE, and low carbon energy scenarios We find that all non-fossil fuel technologies (renewable energy, EE, low carbon) create more jobs per unit energy than coal and natural gas. Aggressive EE measures combined with a 30{\%} RPS target in 2030 can generate over 4 million full-time-equivalent job-years by 2030 while increasing nuclear power to 25{\%} and CCS to 10{\%} of overall generation in 2030 can yield an additional 500,000 job-years. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Can environmental tax reform produce a double dividend - help the environment without hurting the economy? This paper reviews the practical experience and available modeling studies. It concludes that when environmental tax revenues are used to reduce payroll taxes, and if wage-price inflation is prevented, significant reductions in pollution, small gains in employment, and marginal gains or losses in production are likely in the short to medium term, while investments fall back and prices increase. Results are less certain in the long term. They might be more positive if models selected welfare instead of production indicators for the second dividend, and if several important variables, such as wage rigidities and the feedback of environmental quality on production, were factored into simulations.

abstract = {In this paper we present an up-to-date literature review on employment opportunities associated with the deployment of renewable energy technology. We identified approximately 70 studies and data sources published over the past decade that report analysed or observed employment impacts of renewable energy growth. These publications cover many different countries and several technology options, and present widely varying results derived from distinct methodological approaches. Our first overall conclusion is that there is clear lack of authenticity of findings in this literature, since recursive referencing abounds and relatively few studies yield truly original research. When we omit non-authentic analyses, as well as those that aggregate results in a way that does not allow us to calculate ‘employment factors' (defined as the number of jobs or amount of work generated per unit of electricity production capacity), the total list of references is brought to 31 independent items. Of these, only 14 references provide separate estimates of the employment factors for the stages of manufacturing and installation, respectively, as opposed to employment factors for these two activities combined. A total of 23 items provide values for operation and maintenance employment factors. We observe significant uncertainties in quoted figures for job creation, both across and within publications.},

[eng] One speaks about double dividend when the revenue neutral substitution of environmental taxes for other taxes leads to both an environmental benefit and an economic one. The first theoretical studies of this question, in a general equilibrium framework, argue that there is no secondary benefit in the sense of a reduction in tax distorsions. However, there are cases in which positive welfare gains can be obtained : when the environmental tax reform involves a tax shirting from labor to other factors or when there are feedbacks effects from environmental quality to the economic system. When studying this issue under the assumptions of imperfect competition and non clearing labour market, the occurrence of a double dividend becomes more likely.},

abstract = {The federal government and many states have adopted policies to promote the development of various renewable energy technologies for generating electricity. These policies include tax subsidies, direct subsidies, loan guaran- tees, purchase obligations, and long-term con- tracting requirements. The primary renewable generating technologies affected are wind and various solar electric generating technologies, and I will focus on those technologies here. The primary argument for these promotional and regulatory policies is to substitute no or low carbon electricity generation technologies for less costly fossil-fueled technologies absent an appropriate price on CO2 emissions. A related argument for these policies is that experience effects will eventually make renewable tech- nologies “competitive” with conventional gen- erating technologies even in the absence of CO2 emissions prices. I demonstrate here that the life-cycle cost metric typically used to compare the economics of conventional and renewable generating technologies is flawed and that an alternative market-based framework will yield more accurate economic comparisons and estimates of the actual cost of displacing CO2 emissions.},

By employing a general equilibrium model, this paper finds that, contrary to common wisdom, environmental taxes typically render the overall tax system a less efficient instrument to finance public spending. Furthermore,high estimates for the marginal efficiency costs of existing taxes weaken, rather than strengthen, the case for environmental taxes. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Patuelli2005,
abstract = {In this paper, we offer a meta-analytical synthesis of recent (simulation) studies on environmental tax reform (ETR). The studies considered here look at both environmental effects (e.g., reduction in CO2 emission) and economic effects (e.g., employment gains) consequent upon such a tax reform. The existing statistical results from the literature mainly suggest that the tax type, the recycling policy, and the economic model used in the simulations significantly influence the chance that a 'double dividend' effect can be obtained. These empirical results are, however, not entirely conclusive regarding the question of which combination of policies and models will lead to a higher double dividend. This issue is investigated in our study by a quantitative meta-analytic approach. Our meta-analytic statistical experiment demonstrates that the total effect of a tax-and-recycle policy has a significant influence on the economic variables (second dividend), when employment is used. It is also shown that different definitions of the double dividend contribute in determining the success of ETR, in particular since the effects on GDP are less clear than for employment. These findings should be taken into consideration when deploying an ETR in a policy context, in order to prevent a situation where ETR is rejected or accepted solely due to characteristics of one simulation study rather than through a wide set of results from different studies.},

abstract = {Quantitative models for climate policy modeling differ in the production structure used and in the sizes of the elasticities of substitution. The empirical foundation for both is generally lacking. This paper estimates the parameters of 2-level CES production functions with capital, labour and energy as inputs, and is the first to systematically compare all nesting structures. Using industry-level data from 12 OECD countries, we find that the nesting structure where capital and labour are combined first, fits the data best, but for most countries and industries we cannot reject that all three inputs can be put into one single nest. These two nesting structures are used by most climate models. However, while several climate policy models use a Cobb-Douglas function for (part of the) production function, we reject elasticities equal to one, in favour of considerably smaller values. Finally we find evidence for factor-specific technological change. With lower elasticities and with factor-specific technological change, some climate policy models may find a bigger effect of endogenous technological change on mitigating the costs of climate policy. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A key risk factor for numerous chronic diseases, obesity is a major public health concern. This book contributes to evidence-based policy making by exploring multiple dimensions of the obesity problem. It examines the scale and characteristics of the epidemic, the respective roles and influence of market forces and governments, and the impact of interventions. It outlines an economic approach to the prevention of chronic diseases that provides novel insights relative to a more traditional public health approach. The analysis was undertaken by the OECD, partly in collaboration with the World Health Organization. The main chapters are complemented by special contributions from health and obesity experts, including Marc Suhrcke, Tim Lobstein, Donald Kenkel and Francesco Branca. “a valuable set of results and suggestions about the best preventive interventions to reduce the burden of obesity.” – Julio Frenk, Dean, Harvard School of Public Health “The positive message of this book is that the obesity epidemic can be successfully addressed.” – Ala Alwan, Assistant Director-General, World Health Organization “innovative and well-researched” – Martin McKee, Professor, London School of Hygiene {\&} Tropical Medicine "A timely, valuable volume on a critical issue.

abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the market value of variable renewable energy (VRE). The inherent variability of wind speeds and solar radiation affects the price that VRE generators receive on the market (market value). During windy and sunny times the additional electricity supply reduces the prices. Because the drop is larger with more installed capacity, the market value of VRE falls with higher penetration rate. This study aims to develop a better understanding on how the market value with penetration, and how policies and prices affect the market value. Quantitative evidence is derived from a review of published studies, regression analysis of market data, and the calibrated model of the European electricity market EMMA. We find the value of wind power to fall from 110{\%} of the average power price to 50-80{\%} as wind penetration increases from zero to 30{\%} of total electricity consumption. For solar power, similarly low value levels are reached already at 15{\%} penetration. Hence, competitive large-scale renewable deployment will be more difficult to accomplish than as many anticipate. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
