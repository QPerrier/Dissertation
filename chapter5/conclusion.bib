abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the market value of variable renewable energy (VRE). The inherent variability of wind speeds and solar radiation affects the price that VRE generators receive on the market (market value). During windy and sunny times the additional electricity supply reduces the prices. Because the drop is larger with more installed capacity, the market value of VRE falls with higher penetration rate. This study aims to develop a better understanding on how the market value with penetration, and how policies and prices affect the market value. Quantitative evidence is derived from a review of published studies, regression analysis of market data, and the calibrated model of the European electricity market EMMA. We find the value of wind power to fall from 110{\%} of the average power price to 50-80{\%} as wind penetration increases from zero to 30{\%} of total electricity consumption. For solar power, similarly low value levels are reached already at 15{\%} penetration. Hence, competitive large-scale renewable deployment will be more difficult to accomplish than as many anticipate. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

annote = {From Duplicate 2 (Regulation, unemployment, and cost-benefit analysis - Masur, Jonathan S; Posner, Eric A)

Agencies perform cost-benefit analyses. They often look at employment impacts, in particular through feasibility analyses (a regulation should not cause widespread plant closures).
No academic literature on job loss analysis. As to now, practice is just to account the number of lost jobs (compared to an acceptable threshold), in parallel to cost-benefit analysis. There is no interaction between the two.

Masur and Mosner take the example of an NHTSA regulation on fuel standards (and then other cases). NHTSA chose a regulation based on cost-analysis. There is just a check that unemployment would not be too high - without defining what is "high". As if unemployment were incommensurable, when welfare and environmental protection are.

Unemployment effectively functions as a veto point. But without a standard by which to gauge how much unemployment is too much, agency decisions will be in- consistent and impossible to evaluate.

For many people, work has an intrinsic value n, which is the pleasure to work, status or dignity. If c is the cost of working (lost leisure) and w the wage, then the benefit of working is w - c + n. 

Costs of unemployment are: 1) the lost wages minus benefits of leisure; 2) any search or retraining costs; 3) any pemanent reduction in wage (due to firm specific human capital); 4) psychological stress.

The difficulty of finding a new job depends on age, sex, region, education and experience, i.e. demographics. It also depends whether it is a mass layoff or an individual layoff. Finally, it depends whether the industry is booming or shrinking.

unemployment insurance pay- outs are not additional costs that should be included in cost-benefit analysis. [p45] It would be double counting with other costs.

By integrating cost of unemployment in cost-benefit analyses, some regulations are not acceptable. The authors use the for 35,000-100,000{\$} per worker.},

abstract = {abstract Previous studiesfind that the economic value of electricity (USD/MWh) generated bywind power drops with in- creasingmarket share. Differentmeasures can help mitigate the value drop, including electricity storage, flexible conventional plants, expansion of transmission, and demand response. This study assesses another option: a change in design of wind power plants. “Advanced” wind turbines that are higher and have a larger rotor com- pared to rated capacity (lower specific rating) generate electricity more constantly than “classical” turbines. Re- cent years have witnessed a significant shift towards such advanced technology. Our model-based analysis for Northwestern Europe shows that such design can substantially increase the spotmarket value of generated electricity. At a 30{\%} penetration rate, the value of 1MWh of electricity generated froma fleet of advanced turbines is estimated to be15{\%}higher thanthevalue of 1MWhfromclassical turbines. The additional value is large,whether compared to wind generation costs, to the value drop, or to the effect of alternative measures such as electricity storage. Extensive sensitivity tests indicate that this finding is remarkably robust. The increase in bulk power value is not the only advantage of advanced turbines: additional benefits might accrue from reduced costs for power grids and balancing services. To fully realize this potential, power markets and support policies need to be appropriately designed and signal scarcity investors.},

abstract = {This paper important developments in epistemology, and defends a theoretical framework for evidence scholarship from the perspective of naturalized epistemology. It demonstrates that naturalized epistemology provides a firm conceptual foundation for much research into law of evidence. These developments in epistemology have not been much noted in legal scholarship, despite their importance in philosophy and their coincidence with some widely shared approaches to evidence scholarship. This article is a partial antidote for the unproductive fascination in some quarters of the legal academy with "postmodern" conceptions of knowledge and truth and to the even more common search by the legal professoriat for algorithms that provide answers to important legal questions. In the field of evidence, there is some interest in post-modern epistemology, and much searching for the appropriate algorithm, such as Bayesian decision theory or micro-economics, or simply the complete neglect of epistemological matters. The article argues that the naturalistic turn in epistemology of the past thirty years (especially that branch of naturalized epistemology known as social epistemology) provides the appropriate theoretical framework for the study of evidence, as it does for virtually any enterprise concerned with the empirical adequacy of its theories and the truth-generating capacity of its methodologies. Evidence scholarship and law are concerned with both, and thus naturalized epistemology provides a fruitful way of understanding the limitations of some of the existing efforts to provide theoretical and philosophical foundations to evidence law. It also provides a way to conceptualize and evaluate specific rules of evidence, and concomitantly explains what most evidence scholars do, regardless of their explicit philosophical commitments. For the great bulk of evidentiary scholars, this article should solidify the ground beneath their feet.},

The empirical foundation for both is generally lacking. This paper estimates the parameters of 2-level CES production functions with capital, labour and energy as inputs, and is the first to systematically compare all nesting structures. Using industry-level data from 12 OECD countries, we find that the nesting structure where capital and labour are combined first, fits the data best, but for most countries and industries we cannot reject that all three inputs can be put into one single nest. These two nesting structures are used by most climate models. However, while several climate policy models use a Cobb-Douglas function for (part of the) production function, we reject elasticities equal to one, in favour of considerably smaller values. Finally we find evidence for factor-specific technological change. With lower elasticities and with factor-specific technological change, some climate policy models may find a bigger effect of endogenous technological change on mitigating the costs of climate policy. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.
